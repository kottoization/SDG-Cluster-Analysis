# Sustainable Development Goals Analysis

This project aims to analyze how European Union (EU) countries meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using cluster analysis techniques. The analysis focuses on understanding the performance of EU countries in achieving various SDGs and identifying patterns and similarities among them.

## Introduction
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of global goals adopted by the United Nations member states in 2015 to address various social, economic, and environmental challenges by 2030. This project specifically investigates the progress of EU countries towards achieving these goals and aims to provide insights into their performance.

## Methodology
The analysis utilizes cluster analysis techniques to group EU countries based on their progress towards different SDGs. By clustering countries with similar performance, the project aims to identify common trends and disparities among them. The clustering process involves various statistical methods to determine the optimal number of clusters and assign countries to appropriate groups.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes publicly available data on SDG indicators for EU countries. The data includes various metrics related to each SDG, such as poverty, education, healthcare, environmental sustainability, and economic growth. These indicators provide a comprehensive overview of each country's performance in relation to the SDGs.

## Repository
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources used in the analysis. The main analysis scripts, data files, and documentation are provided to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the results.
